/*
Average of Values 
To get the average of a series of values, you add the values up and then divide the sum 
by the number of values. Write a program that stores the following values in five different 
 *  variables:  28,  32,  37,  24,  and  33.  The  program  should  first  calculate  the  sum 
of these five variables and store the result in a separate variable named  
sum. Then, the program  should divide the sum variable  by  5  to  get  the  average.  Display the average 
on the screen.
